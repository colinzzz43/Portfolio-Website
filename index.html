          Designated as scrum master for the entirety of project.
          Used Android Studio for client side, Express (Node) and SQL for server side, Heroku for deployment,
          and Postman for endpoint-testing.        
        </p>
        <h3>Tower Defense Web Game</h3>
        <p>
          Built a tower-defense web game that was deployed on GitHub Pages.
          Utilized circle collision detection to trigger attack mechanisms between monsters and towers. 
          Designed a simple pathfinding algorithm that allowed monsters to walk along a designated path.        
        </p>
        <h3>Wireless Vantage Pro 2</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a desktop application that simulates weather sensors by 
          generating various weather data and displays 
          them onto a GUI for the Wireless Vantage Pro 2. 
          Java 8 was used due to its cross-platform nature.
